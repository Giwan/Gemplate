# Gemplate

## Introduction
A Template project using React, ES6 (with Babel). A single style document is used for the entire project using SASS. More can be added if need be.

## NPM & Webpack
Having the right NPM packages and the corresponding webpack configuration allows for a simple project to be started quickly. The most important packages are:

1. Babel
Allows for ECMA2015 or ES6 Javascript features. Very useful to build using the new features.

2. Loaders
Various loaders are used by Webpack to ensure that the files re converted correctly for the build directory.

3. Directories
The basic webpack configuration also ensures that the files are copied to the build directory.
